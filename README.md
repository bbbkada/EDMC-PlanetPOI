# EDMC Planet Poi Plugin

Plugin for [EDMC](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector) that lets you save positions on planets/bodys and help you navigate to them.  
This plugin is still under development.  

To get ingame overlay, you need [EDMCOverlay](https://github.com/inorton/EDMCOverlay) installed.  
  
in setting you can adjust max poi¨s to show, if body has multiple saved. Adjust the position, and choose if altitude is added to distance or not.
You can create poi¨s manually by entering coords or if at the location, save current location.

The EDMC gui will show saved POI´s for the current body when entering orbit, as soon as the dashboard shows coordinates.  
You can use the gui checkboxes to enable/disable ingame overlay for individual Poi¨s.
